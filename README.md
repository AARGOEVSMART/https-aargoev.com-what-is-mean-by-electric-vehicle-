An electric vehicle or EV is any vehicle powered by an electric motor rather than an internal combustion engine or IC engine energized by the burning of fuel or gas. An electric vehicle motor is powered by an electric current collector from an off-vehicle service provider or from an on-board source such as a battery, solar power, or an electric generator that converts the fuel in electricity.  An electric vehicle includes electric cars, buses, two-wheelers, electric water vassals, and electric aircraft.  Generally, EV’s are referred to as cars, buses of all sizes, and trucks in today’s world. The electric vehicles are divided into three categories that are battery charged electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles (that are partially powered by an electric motor), and fuel cell vehicles (hydrogen gas is used to power electric motor).  The invention of electric vehicles has been done decades ago, but it came into consideration in the 21st century to meet global issues like pollution, global warming, and exhaustion of natural and non-renewable resources caused by the vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine. Zero-emission electric vehicles are the only possible and practical substitutes for vehicles leaving carbon footprints and other environmental-related problems.
